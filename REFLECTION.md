# Reflection

## PROJECT OF: Calvin Childress and Hunter Halloran

## FRI 2018-11-30 @ 10:48 PM EST

1. **DONE:** Project cloned and set up for commits, pushes, and pulls. Both games started with
   proper class structure.

2. **TODO:** Work on Tetris gravity and translating checkers rules to game function.

3. **PROB:** Took a bit of time to set up proper git tools for group version control,
   as well as working on making sure the project would be reasonably structured for
   multiple people's use.

1. **DONE:** Checkers board created, Tetris gravity and horizonal movement finished.

2. **TODO:** Implement Tetris rotation and checkers gamepieces.

3. **PROB:** It has been a bit difficult trying to research how Tetris pieces are
   supposed to move concerning wallkicks, and the UI of checkers was being a tad
   finicky.
