1. **DONE:** Project cloned and set up for commits, pushes, and pulls. Both games started with
   proper class structure.

2. **TODO:** Work on Tetris gravity and translating checkers rules to game function.

3. **PROB:** Took a bit of time to set up proper git tools for group version control,
   as well as working on making sure the project would be reasonably structured for
   multiple people's use.
