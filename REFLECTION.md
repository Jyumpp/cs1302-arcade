# Reflection

## PROJECT OF: Calvin Childress and Hunter Halloran

## FRI 2018-11-30 @ 10:48 PM EST

1. **DONE:** Project cloned and set up for commits, pushes, and pulls. Both games started with
   proper class structure.

2. **TODO:** Work on Tetris gravity and translating checkers rules to game function.

3. **PROB:** Took a bit of time to set up proper git tools for group version control,
   as well as working on making sure the project would be reasonably structured for
   multiple people's use.

## FRI 2018-12-7 @ 11:39 PM EST

1. **DONE:** Checkers board created, Tetris gravity and horizonal movement finished.

2. **TODO:** Implement Tetris rotation and checkers gamepieces.

3. **PROB:** It has been a bit difficult trying to research how Tetris pieces are
   supposed to move concerning wallkicks, and the UI of checkers was being a tad
   finicky.
   
## TUE 2018-12-11 @ 3:08 PM EST

1. **DONE:** Tetris is done! It actually plays well! 
   The game select was given images and checkers is playable.
   
2. **TODO:** Submit!

3. **PROB:** Wow Tetris is a more complicated game than we thought!
   But we got that working smoothly! It took some fiddling to get a
   game over animation to work properly for it, and kinged
   pieces in checkers turned out to be harder than expected.
   
4. **MISC:** Also, we turned in our application for the earlier deadline
   :)
